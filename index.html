I am a dedicated and hardworking individual with a passion for problem solving and coding. My interests include camping, hiking, reading, spending time with friends, and of course coding. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, PHP, SQL, and COBOL. My portfolio website showcases my skills and projects, and it serves as a representation of my abilities as a developer. I am excited to share my work with you and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the needs of your organization. Thank you for visiting!</p>
